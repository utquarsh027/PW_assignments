    "Outliers can significantly affect both measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion in a dataset. An outlier is an extreme value that lies far away from the bulk of the other data points in the dataset. These extreme values can distort the calculations of central tendency and spread, leading to misleading or inaccurate results. Here's how outliers impact these measures with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset of exam scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "{78, 82, 85, 90, 95, 98, 100, 102, 105, 55}\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of data points. In this case, the mean would be (78 + 82 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 98 + 100 + 102 + 105 + 55) / 10 = 90.\n",
    "Median: The median represents the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order. In this case, the median would be 95, as there are 5 values below and 5 values above it.\n",
    "Now, let's introduce an outlier in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "{78, 82, 85, 90, 95, 98, 100, 102, 105, 55, 200}\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of Outliers on Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is now (78 + 82 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 98 + 100 + 102 + 105 + 55 + 200) / 11 â‰ˆ 107. The presence of the outlier significantly increases the mean, shifting it away from the center of the data.\n",
    "Median: The median remains the same, as it is not influenced by the value of the outlier. The median is still 95.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. Without the outlier, the range would be 105 - 55 = 50. However, with the outlier, the range becomes 200 - 55 = 145. The presence of the outlier significantly increases the spread of the data.\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: These measures are affected by extreme values. The outlier increases the variability in the data and consequently increases both the variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "In this example, the outlier (200) has a notable impact on both the mean and range. The mean is pulled towards the extreme value, and the range is considerably increased. The median, however, remains unaffected by the outlier. When dealing with outliers, it's essential to carefully consider their impact on the measures of central tendency and dispersion to ensure a more accurate representation of the dataset. Depending on the context and the nature of the data, handling outliers can involve different approaches, such as removing them, transforming the data, or using robust statistical measures that are less influenced by extreme values."
